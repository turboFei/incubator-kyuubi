# Kinit Auxiliary Service

Kinit auxiliary service is a critical service both for authentication between Kyuubi client/server 
and for authentication between Kyuubi server/Hadoop cluster in a Kerberos environment.
It will get a Kerberos Ticket Cache from KDC and periodically re-kinit to keep the Ticket Cache fresh.

**Note**:  
- Kinit auxiliary service is critical to Kyuubi Kerberos authentication, but not vice versa.
- Kinit auxiliary service can also work with other authentication mode.

## Installing and Configuring the Kerberos Clients

Usually, Kerberos client is installed as default. You can validate it using `klist` tool.

```bash
$ klist -V
Kerberos 5 version 1.15.1
```

If the client is not installed, you should install it ahead based on the OS platform that you prepare to run Kyuubi.

`krb5.conf` is a configuration file for tuning up the creation of Kerberos ticket cache.
The default location is `/etc` on Linux,
and we can use `KRB5_CONFIG` environmental variable to overwrite the location of the configuration file.

Replace or configure `krb5.conf` to point to the KDC.

## Kerberos Ticket

Kerberos client is aimed to generate a Ticket Cache file.
Then, Kyuubi can use this Ticket Cache to authenticate with those kerberized services,
e.g. HDFS, YARN, and Hive Metastore server, etc.

A Kerberos ticket cache contains a service and a client principal names,
lifetime indicators, flags, and the credential itself, e.g.

```bash
$ klist

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_5441
Default principal: spark/kyuubi.host.name@KYUUBI.APACHE.ORG

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
2020-11-25T13:17:18  2020-11-26T13:17:18  krbtgt/KYUUBI.APACHE.ORG@KYUUBI.APACHE.ORG
	renew until 2020-12-02T13:17:18
```

Kerberos credentials can be stored in Kerberos ticket cache.
For example, `/tmp/krb5cc_5441` in the above case.

They are valid for relatively short period. So, we always need to refresh it for long-running services like Kyuubi.

When working with a Kerberos-enabled Hadoop cluster, we should ensure that `hadoop.security.authentication` 
is set to `KERBEROS` in `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR/core-site.xml` or `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf/kyuubi-defaults.conf`. 
Then we need to specify `kyuubi.kinit.principal` and `kyuubi.kinit.keytab` for authentication. 


For example,

```bash
kyuubi.kinit.principal=spark/kyuubi.apache.org@KYUUBI.APACHE.ORG
kyuubi.kinit.keytab=/path/to/kyuuib.keytab
```

**Note**:  
`kyuubi.kinit.principal` must be in the format: `<user>/<host>@<realm>`, and `<host>` must 
be a FQDN of the host Kyuubi is running.

Kyuubi will use this `principal` to impersonate client users,
so the cluster should enable it to do impersonation for some particular user from some particular hosts.

For example,

```bash
hadoop.proxyuser.<user name in principal>.groups *
hadoop.proxyuser.<user name in principal>.hosts *
```
