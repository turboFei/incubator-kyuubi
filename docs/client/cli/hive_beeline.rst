Hive Beeline
============

Kyuubi supports Apache Hive beeline that works with Kyuubi server.
Hive beeline is a `SQLLine CLI <http://sqlline.sourceforge.net/>`_ based on the `Hive JDBC Driver <../jdbc/hive_jdbc.html>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Kyuubi server installed and launched.
- Hive beeline installed

   It always uses remote mode for connecting beeline with a separate server process over thrift.
