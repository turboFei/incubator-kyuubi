**Good First Issue** is initiative to curate easy pickings for first-time
contributors. It helps you locate suitable development tasks with beginner's
skills required, and finally make your first contribution to Kyuubi.

After solving one or more good first issues, you should be able to

- Find efficient ways to communicate with the community and get help
- Setup `develop environment`_ on your machine
- `Build`_ Kyuubi from source
- `Run tests`_ locally
- `Submit a pull request`_ through Github
- Be listed in `Apache Kyuubi contributors`_
- And most importantly, you can move to the next level and try some tricky issues

.. note:: Don't linger too long at this stage.

   :alt: GitHub issues by-label
   :target: `Help Wanted Issues`_

Issues that maintainers labeled as help wanted are mostly

- sub-tasks of an ongoing shorthanded umbrella
- non-urgent improvements
- bug fixes for corner cases
- feature requests not covered by current technology stack of kyuubi community

Since these problems are not urgent, you can take your time when fixing them.

.. note:: Help wanted issues may contain easy pickings and tricky ones.
